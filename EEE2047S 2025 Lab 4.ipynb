    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not obvious how to represent a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ in a way that can be manipulated by a computer.  The time index is real-valued, so even if we only care about the signal value over a finite interval there are infinitely many function values to consider and store.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to assume that $x(t)$ varies slowly, and hope that sampling $x(t)$ at $t=nT$ for $n$ integer and $T$ small is sufficient to characterise the signal.  This leads to the discrete-time signal $x[n] = x(nT)$.  When this assumption is formalised and holds then the method works, and we use it a lot.  The first part of this workbook explores how a discrete signal $x[n]$ can be used to represent or parameterise a continuous-time $x(t)$.  Understanding this link and its limitations lets us process \"analog\" signals $x(t)$ using digital processing of the corresponding $x[n]$.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general option is to represent the continuous-time signal $x(t)$ as a linear combination of a fixed set of known basis functions $b_n(t)$:\n",
    "$$x(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_n b_n(t).$$\n",
    "Here the signal $x(t)$ is defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, but as written it is completely specified by the finite and discrete set of values $c_n, n=0, \\ldots, N-1$.  Not every signal $x(t)$ can be written in this way, and those that can depends on the choice of functions $b_n(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple example uses a polynomial basis with $b_n(t) = t^n$.  The signals parameters $c_n$ are then just the coefficients for each polynomial order.  Another is the cosine basis $b_n(t) = \\cos(n \\omega_0 t)$, which can represent all periodic even functions $x(t)$ if $N$ is large enough.  Instead of summing from $0$ to $N-1$ in the representation we might also have infinite bounds like $0$ to $\\infty$, or $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$.  Even then, the coefficients $c_n$ are still a countable set and can be carefully used to represent or process the continuous-time $x(t)$ that they represent.  The second part of this workbook explores this concept."

    "## Reconstruction from discrete samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that $b_0(t)$ is an even function centered on the origin $t=0$, and for each $n$ the basis function $b_n(t)$ in the representation equation above is $b_0(t)$ shifted until it is centered on some point $t=nT$:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_n b_0(t-nT).$$\n",
    "This representation is particularly useful if we add the requirement\n",
    "$$b_0(t) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "  1 \\qquad & t=0 \\\\\n",
    "  0 \\qquad & t=nT \\quad \\text{for integer $n$}.\n",
    "  \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now that we have access to a discrete set of regular samples $x[n] = x(nT)$ from $x(t)$, and want to determine the corresponding coefficients $c_n$.  Note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(kT) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_n b_0(kT-nT) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_n b_0((k-n)T) = c_k.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step above follows because $b_0((k-n)T)=1$ only if $k-n=0$, so all the terms in the sum are zero except one.  You could also note that $b_0((k-n)T) = \\delta(k-n)$ and use the sifting property.  Either way $x[k] = x(kT) = c_k$, and the expansion takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] b_0(t-nT).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can view this as a reconstruction formula.  It takes as input the sample values in the form of a discrete signal $x[n]$ for integer $n$, and produces the interpolated or reconstructed continuous-time signal $x(t)$.  The nature of the reconstruction depends on the prototype basis function $b_0(t)$, and different choices lead to interpolation with different properties."
